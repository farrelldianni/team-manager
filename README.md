# team-manager

Using proper testing frameworks (JEST) I created an app to update a team manager. Command line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generate an HTML webpage that dispalys summaries for each person. Testing is key to make code maintainable, so unit testing foa all part of code and ensuring it passes each test.
